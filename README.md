## Setting up

### Installing Logstash Environment Filter Plugin

The logstash configuration file requires `logstash-filter-environment` community-maintained plugin. You may install the plugin by running `bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-environment` or modify the configuration file in order to associate the event types (earthquake or blast) to the `type` of the index.

### Ingesting Data

Extract the dataset archive with `tar zxf ncedc-earthquakes-dataset.tar.gz` from the terminal. Run the below commands to ingest the data sets to your Elasticsearch cluster. Please note, you may need to configure `ncedc-earthquakes-logstash.conf` file in case your are not running Elasticsearch node on your local host.

```
tail +1 earthquakes.txt| EVENT="earthquake" logstash/bin/logstash -f ncedc-earthquakes-logstash.conf
tail +1 blasts.txt| EVENT="blast" logstash/bin/logstash -f ncedc-earthquakes-logstash.conf
```

### Installing Timelion Plugin

The Kibana dashboard requires the `timelion` plugin. You may install the plugin by running `bin/kibana-plugin install timelion`

### Importing Kibana Visuals and Dashboards

1. Open Kibana and go to Settings > Indices. Type in `ncedc-earthquakes` as the index name and create the index pattern.
2. Go to Objects tab and click on Import, and select `ncedc-earthquakes-dashboard.json` by the file chooser.
3. Go to Dashboard and click on `Earthquake` from the list of the dashboards.
